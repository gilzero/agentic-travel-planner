            We conducted a search for a company called '{company}', but the results may include documents from other companies with similar names or domains.
            Your task is to accurately categorize these retrieved documents based on which specific company they pertain to, using the initial company information as "ground truth."

            ### Target Company Information
            - **Company Name**: '{company}'
            - **Primary Domain**: '{target_domain}'
            - **Initial Context (Ground Truth)**: Information below should act as a verification baseline. Use it to confirm that the document content aligns directly with {company}.
            - **{initial_docs}**

            ### Retrieved Documents for Clustering
            Below are the retrieved documents, including URLs and brief content snippets:
            {[{'url': doc['url'], 'snippet': doc['content']} for doc in urls]}

            ### Clustering Instructions
            - **Primary Domain Priority**: Documents with URLs containing '{target_domain}' should be prioritized for the main cluster for '{company}'.
            - **Include Relevant Third-Party Sources**: Documents from third-party domains (e.g., news sites, industry reports) should also be included in the '{company}' cluster if they provide specific information about '{company}', reference '{target_domain}', or closely match the initial company context.
            - **Separate Similar But Distinct Domains**: Documents from similar but distinct domains (e.g., '{target_domain.replace('.com', '.io')}') should be placed in separate clusters unless they explicitly reference the target domain and align with the company's context.
            - **Handle Ambiguities Separately**: Documents that lack clear alignment with '{company}' should be placed in an "Ambiguous" cluster for further review.

            ### Example Output Format
            {{
                "clusters": [
                    {{
                        "company_name": "Name of Company A",
                        "cluster": [
                            "http://example.com/doc1",
                            "http://example.com/doc2"
                        ]
                    }},
                    {{
                        "company_name": "Name of Company B",
                        "cluster": [
                            "http://example.com/doc3"
                        ]
                    }},
                    {{
                        "company_name": "Ambiguous",
                        "cluster": [
                            "http://example.com/doc4"
                        ]
                    }}
                ]
            }}

            ### Key Points
            - **Focus on Relevant Content**: Documents that contain relevant references to '{company}' (even from third-party domains) should be clustered with '{company}' if they align well with the initial information and context provided.
            - **Identify Ambiguities**: Any documents without clear relevance to '{company}' should be placed in the "Ambiguous" cluster for manual review.
